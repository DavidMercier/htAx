# HTAxe
High-Throughput Analysis of XRD and Electrochemistry

HTAxe aims at streamlined insight generation from high-throughput data as obtained at Ruhr-University Bochum. It is intended to be modular and versatile for different kinds of datasets (XRD, Electrochemistry, RGB, UV-Vis Transmission, etc.). In a later version it will interface to our database and allow collaborators to directly co-analyze data. 
A major feature is the accelerated analysis of XRD data from combi experiments. Data may be analyzed using quasi binary cuts of arbitrary shape or by semi-automatic peak matching to known crystal structures.

This Project started through an Undergraduate Summer Internship (REACH Program) from Sally Jiao (Princeton University) and was supervised by Helge Stein (Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum).
