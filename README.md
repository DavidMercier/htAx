# XEAnalysis
XRD and Electrochemistry Analysis

XEAnalysis aims at streamlined insight generation from high-throughput data as obtained at Ruhr-University Bochum. It is intended to be modular and versatile so that different datasets (XRD, Electrochemistry, RGB, UV-Vis Transmission, etc.) can be analyzed. In a later version it will interface to our database and allow collaborators to directly co-analyze data.

This Project started through a Undergraduate Summer Internship (REACH Program) from Sally Jiao (Princeton University) and was supervised by Helge Stein (Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum).
